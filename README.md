## Overview

This repository provides a ready-to-use Docker image to run an Idena node easily and securely, with SSH access and persistent data storage.
Running an Idena node allows you to actively participate in the Idena network, validate transactions, and contribute to decentralization. Running your node via Docker simplifies installation, dependency management, and ensures an isolated and reproducible environment.
For more information about the Idena project, visit [idena.io](https://idena.io/).

## Prerequisites

- Docker (version 20+ recommended)
- Supported OS: Linux, macOS, Windows (with Docker)
- At least 2GB RAM and 2GB free disk space
- Internet connection

---

## Quick Start

First, create a directory on your host to persist node data and, if you have one, copy your `api.key` into it:
```sh
mkdir -p ~/MyDockers/idena-node/datadir
# If you have an existing API key:
# cp /path/to/your/api.key ~/MyDockers/idena-node/datadir/api.key
```

Then, run the container:
```sh
docker run -d \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 60022:22 \
  -p 40405:40405 \
  -p 9999:9999 \
  -v ~/MyDockers/idena-node/datadir:/datadir \
  -e IDENA_USER_ACCOUNT_NAME=idenaUser \
  -e IDENA_USER_ACCOUNT_PASS=idenaUserPassword \
  --name idena-node rinzlerfr/idena-node
```
Options explained:
- `-d`: Runs the container in the background (detached mode).
- `--restart unless-stopped`: Automatically restarts the container unless it has been explicitly stopped (e.g., by `docker stop idena-node`).

> **Note:**
> The SSH port mapping (`-p 60022:22`) is required if you want to connect to your node via SSH, for example to use port forwarding with the command:
> ```sh
> ssh -L 9999:localhost:9009 idenaUser@<host_ip> -p 60022
> ```
> Here, `60022` is just an example: you can replace it with any free port of your choice, as long as you use the same port number in both the `docker run` and `ssh` commands. This is necessary to allow the Idena desktop application to connect to your remote node as if it were local (the application will connect to `http://localhost:9999`).
>
> The `-p 9999:9999` mapping in the `docker run` command exposes the node's API port. If the API service inside the container listens on port `9009` (Idena standard), and you want to access it directly via `http://<host_ip>:9999` (without an SSH tunnel), you should use `-p 9999:9009` instead. If access is *exclusively* via the SSH tunnel (as described above), this direct port mapping `-p 9999:9999` (or `-p 9999:9009`) is not strictly necessary for this specific access method, as the tunnel handles the connection to the container's internal port `9009`. The architecture diagram illustrates API access via the container's internal port `9009`, typically reached through the SSH tunnel.

**Replace:**
- `60022` with your desired SSH port
- `~/MyDockers/idena-node/datadir` with your data directory path
- `idenaUser` and `idenaUserPassword` with your SSH credentials

## Configuration

| Variable                   | Description                        | Required | Example           |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|----------|-------------------|
| IDENA_USER_ACCOUNT_NAME    | SSH user account name              | Yes      | idenaUser         |
| IDENA_USER_ACCOUNT_PASS    | SSH user account password          | Yes      | idenaUserPassword |

**Data directory:**
Create a directory on your host to persist node data (if not already done in Quick Start) and copy your `api.key` into it:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/MyDockers/idena-node/datadir
cp /path/to/your/api.key ~/MyDockers/idena-node/datadir/api.key
```
Your `api.key` is usually found in the `datadir` directory of your existing Idena installation, or is generated by the Idena client when first setting up a local node. If you don't have one, the node will generate one on its first startup, but you will need to retrieve it from the container (e.g., via SSH) to use it with the desktop application.

---

## Usage

### Build the image (optional)

If you want to build the image locally:

```sh
docker build -t idena-node .
```

### Run the container

See [Quick Start](#quick-start).

### Connect to the node from Idena Desktop App

To access your remote node API securely from your local Idena desktop app, use SSH port forwarding:

```sh
ssh -L 9999:localhost:9009 idenaUser@<host_ip> -p 60022
```
(If the Idena Desktop application is running on the same machine as the Docker container, you can use `localhost` as `<host_ip>`.)

Then, in the Idena app, set the node address to:
`http://localhost:9999`

---

## Update Instructions

1. Pull the latest image:
   ```sh
   docker pull rinzlerfr/idena-node
   ```
2. Stop and remove the existing container (data is preserved):
   ```sh
   docker stop idena-node
   docker rm idena-node
   ```
3. Run the container again with your previous command. (Make sure to use the exact same `-p`, `-v`, and `-e` parameters as during the initial launch to preserve your configuration and data.)

---

## Synology NAS Deployment

1. **Install Docker** via the Package Center.
2. **Search for `rinzlerfr/idena-node`** in the Docker registry and download it.
3. **Create the data directory** (e.g., `docker/idena-node/datadir`).
4. **Copy your `api.key`** into the data directory.
5. **(Optional) Migrate existing node data** by copying all files from your old datadir.
6. **Configure and start the container** via the Docker GUI:
   - Set up volumes, ports, and environment variables as described above.

---

## Security Considerations
- **SSH Password:** It is strongly recommended to use a strong and unique SSH password (`IDENA_USER_ACCOUNT_PASS`).
- **SSH Port Exposure:** Carefully consider the implications of exposing your container's SSH port to the internet. If possible, limit access to this port via firewall rules, allowing only trusted IP addresses.
- **API Key:** Protect your `api.key`. Do not share it publicly.

---

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

### Port already in use

Make sure the ports (SSH port like 60022, Idena P2P 40405, Idena API if directly exposed like 9999) are not used by another service on your host.

### Permission denied on /datadir

Ensure the Docker user has read/write permissions on the mapped directory. You can try to fix permissions with `sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) ~/MyDockers/idena-node/datadir` (adapt the path if necessary and ensure the user running this command is the one who created the directory or has sudo rights) or ensure the user running Docker has the rights. On Windows, check Docker Desktop's drive sharing settings.

### Cannot SSH into the container

Check SSH port mapping, username, password, and host IP. Ensure the SSH service is running in the container (it should be by default).

### Container does not restart

Use `--restart unless-stopped` in your `docker run` command.

### How to check container logs?
Use the command `docker logs idena-node` to see the node's output.
